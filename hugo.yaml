      We build and support the next generation of **European technology companies**. With several decades of experience working at technology startups as engineers, tech leads and architects, our focus lies on investing into European companies and individuals. We strongly believe in the innovative power of the tech sector in Europe.


      Only companies with an innovative mindset, that leverage cutting-edge technology will be able to satisfy current and future business and consumer needs. We believe that **cloud native technology** is at the core of any innovation in the coming years; containers and surrounding technology, modern security practices such as software bills of material and provenance attestations as well as a continuous delivery mindset are driving the software engineering and operations initiatives of successful IT projects.
      

      We prefer **[Open Source Software](https://opensource.org/osd)** over proprietary software for better security, quality and benefit to society. We encourage our companies to contribute to Open Source projects and to publish their own software under an [OSI-approved](https://opensource.org/licenses) license by default.
